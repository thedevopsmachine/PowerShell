======================
This repo contains some PowerShell modules and scripts developed personally and while working for Marshall Wace Asset Management. I have been granted permission to Open Source some of the Marshall Wace code to benefit the general public. Big shout out to them for their generosity! I'll be resposible for bug fixing if you come across any. If you do, please report as much info as you can, including iDRAC and server versions.

At this stage testing will only be done on iDRAC7's. iDRAC8's haven't changed much in terms of the CIM API so they should work, but are untested.
